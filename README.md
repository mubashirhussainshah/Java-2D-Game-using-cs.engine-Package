# Java-2D-Game-using-cs.engine-Package
This project is a Java game built using the cs.engine package. It features a platformer-style gameplay where the player controls a character and navigates through various levels. The game includes elements such as enemies, collectibles, health items, and platforms.

The project utilizes the cs.engine library to handle the physics simulation, collision detection, and rendering of game objects. It also incorporates keyboard input handling for character movement and interaction.

The game consists of multiple levels, each with its own set of challenges and objectives. The player must navigate the character through platforms, avoid or defeat enemies, collect coins, and reach the level's exit portal to progress to the next level.

Additionally, the project includes custom classes for different game entities, such as the Student (main character), Enemy (ground-based enemy), and flyingEnemy (flying enemy). These entities have specific behaviors, such as movement patterns and collision interactions with other game objects.

The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and showcases the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and event handling. It also includes sound effects and visual assets to enhance the gaming experience.

Overall, this Java game project showcases the implementation of a platformer-style game using the cs.engine package, providing an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience for players.els.
